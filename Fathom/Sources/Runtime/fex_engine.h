// fex_engine.h -- the FEXCore embedding.
//
// This is the only file that knows FEXCore exists. It owns the context, the guest
// threads, the syscall handler FEXCore calls into, and the mechanism that unwinds out of
// the JIT when a guest thread exits.
//
// The split between the two classes here is the process model. FEXCore's *context* is the
// JIT and its code cache, and there is one of those. A *guest thread* is a register file,
// a stack and an unwind point, and there is one per thread of guest execution -- which,
// in Fathom, is also one per guest process, because processes are guest threads that do
// not share a file descriptor table.
