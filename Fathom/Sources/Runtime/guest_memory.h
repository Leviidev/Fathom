// guest_memory.h -- the guest's address space.
//
// FEXCore is a userspace emulator: a guest address *is* a host address, there is no
// translation layer. So the job here is to obtain host memory at addresses the guest
// can live at, and to remember what the guest believes about each range.
//
// Two host facts shape everything in this file:
//
//   * Apple Silicon's host page size is 16KB, while x86-64 guests assume 4KB. Guest
//     pages are therefore never mapped individually -- a whole region is mapped once
//     and sub-ranges are tracked logically. Asking the host for 4KB granularity would
//     fail, and silently assuming 4096 is exactly the bug FEX's own Darwin port had to
//     fix in half a dozen places.
//
//   * Guest "executable" is a bookkeeping property, not a host one. FEXCore reads guest
//     code as data and emits ARM64 for it, so guest code pages only need to be
//     host-*readable*. Nothing here ever asks for PROT_EXEC, which is what lets guest
//     memory work on iOS without any JIT entitlement at all (only FEXCore's own code
//     buffers need that).
